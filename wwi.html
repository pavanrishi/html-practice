        The the-sandman is the netfilx webseries.The Sandman is an American fantasy drama television series based on the 1989â€“1996 comic book written by Neil Gaiman and published by DC Comics. The series was developed by Gaiman, David S. Goyer, and Allan Heinberg
        for the streaming service Netflix, and is produced by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. Like the comic, The Sandman tells the story of Dream/Morpheus, the titular Sandman. The series stars Tom Sturridge as the title character, with
        Boyd Holbrook, Vivienne Acheampong, and Patton Oswalt in supporting roles. Efforts to adapt The Sandman to film began in 1991 but floundered in development hell for many years. In 2013, Goyer pitched a film adaptation of the series to Warner Bros.
        Goyer and Gaiman were set to produce alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was planned to star and possibly direct. However, Gordon-Levitt exited over creative differences in 2016. Due to the prolonged development of the film, Warner Bros. shifted
        its focus to television. Netflix signed a deal to produce the series in June 2019, and filming lasted from October 2020 to August 2021. The Sandman premiered on August 5, 2022, with an additional episode premiering on August 19. It received generally
        positive reviews from critics, with praise going towards the casting, production design, costumes, faithfulness to its source material, visual effects, and performances, particularly those of Sturridge and David Thewlis.</p>
